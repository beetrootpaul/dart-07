--- Returns the absolute (positive) value of x
---
---
--- - API docs: https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#ABS
---
--- - Wiki: https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/Abs
---
--- @param x number
--- @return number
function abs(x)
end

--- Add value VAL to the end of table TBL. Equivalent to: TBL[#TBL + 1] = VAL
---
--- If index is given then the element is inserted at that position.
---
---
--- - API docs: https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#ADD
---
--- - Wiki: https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/Add
---
--- @param tbl table
--- @param val any
--- @param index number optional
function add(tbl, val, index)
end

--- Used in FOR loops to iterate over all items in a table (that have a 1-based integer index), in the order they were added.
---
--- Discouraged because of bad performance, consider using PAIRS instead.
---
---
--- - API docs: https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#ALL
---
--- - Wiki: https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/All
---
--- @param tbl table
function all(tbl)
end

--- If CONDITION is false, stop the program and print MESSAGE if it is given.
--- This can be useful for debugging cartridges, by ASSERT()'ing that things that you expect to be true are indeed true.
---
---
--- - API docs: https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#ASSERT
---
--- - Wiki: https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/Assert
---
--- @param condition any
--- @param message string optional
--- @return any all arguments as passed to assert() in a tuple (if the assert didn't fail).
function assert(condition, message)
end

--- Get button B state for player PL (default 0)
---
--- If no parameters supplied, returns a bitfield of all 12 button states for player 0 & 1 (P0: bits 0..5 P1: bits 8..13)
---
---
--- - API docs: https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#BTN
---
--- - Wiki: https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/Btn
---
--- @param b number|string a glyph or from 0 to 5: left, right, up, down, button_o, button_x
--- @param pl number player, from 0 to 7, optional, default: 0
--- @return boolean|number whether button is pressed or not, or a bitfield
function btn(b, pl)
end

--- BTNP is short for "Button Pressed"; Instead of being true when a button is held down,
--- BTNP returns true when a button is down AND it was not down the last frame. It also
--- repeats after 15 frames, returning true every 4 frames after that (at 30fps -- double
--- that at 60fps). This can be used for things like menu navigation or grid-wise player
--- movement.
---
--- The state that BTNP reads is reset at the start of each call to _UPDATE or _UPDATE60,
--- so it is preferable to use BTNP from inside one of those functions.
---
--- Custom delays (in frames 30fps) can be set by poking the following memory addresses:
---
---  - POKE(0X5F5C, DELAY) -- SET THE INITIAL DELAY BEFORE REPEATING. 255 MEANS NEVER REPEAT.
---
---  - POKE(0X5F5D, DELAY) -- SET THE REPEATING DELAY.
---
--- In both cases, 0 can be used for the default behaviour (delays 15 and 4)

--- Used in FOR loops to iterate over table TBL, providing both the key and value for each item.
---
--- Unlike ALL(), PAIRS() iterates over every item regardless of indexing scheme. Order is not guaranteed.
---
---
--- - API docs: https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#PAIRS
---
--- - Wiki: https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/Pairs
---
--- @param tbl table
function pairs(tbl)
end

--- PAL() swaps colour c0 for c1 for one of three palette re-mappings (p defaults to 0):
---
--- - 0: Draw Palette
---
---   The draw palette re-maps colours when they are drawn. For example, an orange flower sprite can be drawn as a red flower by setting the 9th palette value to 8:
---   PAL(9,8) -- draw subsequent orange (colour 9) pixels as red (colour 8) SPR(1,70,60) -- any orange pixels in the sprite will be drawn with red instead
---
---   Changing the draw palette does not affect anything that was already drawn to the screen.
---
--- - 1: Display Palette
---
---   The display palette re-maps the whole screen when it is displayed at the end of a frame. For example, if you boot PICO-8 and then type PAL(6,14,1),
---   you can see all of the gray (colour 6) text immediate change to pink (colour 14) even though it has already been drawn.
---   This is useful for screen-wide effects such as fading in/out.
---
--- - 2: Secondary Palette
---
---   Used by FILLP() for drawing sprites. This provides a mapping from a single 4-bit colour index to two 4-bit colour indexes.
---
--- PAL() resets all palettes to system defaults (including transparency values) PAL(P) resets a particular palette (0..2) to system defaults
---
---
--- - API docs: https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#PAL
---
--- - Wiki: https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/Pal
---
--- @param c0 number|table color to swap from or table of colors to swap to (where table index is color to swap from, with an extra "[0]=" to swap from black, because tables are 1-based)
--- @param c1 number color to swap to, absent if c0 is a table
--- @param p number palette re-mapping mode (0, 1, 2), optional, default: 0
function pal(c0, c1, p)
end

--- Set transparency for colour index to T (boolean). Transparency is observed by SPR(), SSPR(), MAP() AND TLINE()
---
--- PALT() resets to default: all colours opaque except colour 0.
---
--- When C is the only parameter, it is treated as a bitfield used to set all 16 values. For example: to set colours 0 and 1 as transparent:

function print(str, x, y, col)
end

--- Print a string to the host operating system's console for debugging.
---
--- If filename is set, append the string to a file on the host operating system (in the current directory by default -- use FOLDER to view).
---
--- Setting OVERWRITE to true causes that file to be overwritten rather than appended.
---
--- Setting SAVE_TO_DESKTOP to true saves to the desktop instead of the current path.
---

--- Returns the cosine or sine of x, where 1.0 means a full turn.
---
--- PICO-8's SIN() returns an inverted result to suit screenspace (where Y means "DOWN", as opposed to mathematical diagrams where Y typically means "UP").
---
--- > SIN(0.25) -- RETURNS -1

---
--- > P8COS = COS FUNCTION COS(ANGLE) RETURN P8COS(ANGLE/(3.1415*2)) END
---

---
--- - CHANNEL -2: to stop the given sound from playing on any channel
